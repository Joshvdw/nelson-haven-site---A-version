        <p>Many people live on the coasts of the Nelson region or in the Marlborough Sounds.
          Even more people value these areas - and may have views of the sea or visit the Marlborough Sounds or Tasman and Golden Bays for fun and recreation -
          your knowledge is needed in deciding just what activities are appropriate in and along our coast and in the marine environment.</p>
        <p>In many instances people "on the ground" may be of help in submissions and research that the Friends undertake.</p>
        <p><b>Activities to watch for and record include:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Boat traffic, large and small vessels, rigs</li>
          <li>Navigational routes through area</li>
          <li>Yacht, boat races, regattas, water skiing, diving, snorkeling and other amenity uses</li>
          <li>Orca, dolphin and other ocean mammal activities</li>

          <li>Pollution</li>
          <li>Inappropriate activities</li>
          <li>Activities such as sedimentation in estuaries or draining of wetlands</li>
          <li>Illegal activities around river mouths and unconsented coastal "protection works"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Removal of vegetation and issues concerning birds and other wildlife are of concern to the Friends as well as inappropriate coastal developments of all kinds.</p>

        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <div class="paragraph__container">
          <p>Friends formed in 1973 as a result of public concern over plans for extensive reclamation of the Nelson Haven tidal flats.</p>
          <p>Since then the Society has continued to take action to protect our increasingly threatened estuaries, shores and coastal waters.
            The work has extended to include the coastal environment of Nelson Province and Marlborough.</p>
          <p>Beautiful scenery long with an equable climate make the area popular for recreation and tourism.
            There are large commercial fin fish and shell fish operations along the coast, and in the sea.</p>
          <p>The population in Tasman Bay, Golden Bay and the Marlborough Sounds is expanding rapidly.
            This northern coast at the Top of the South Island has several large estuarine areas - each equal in environmental productivity to a tropical rain forest.</p>
          <p>Over 30 species of local and migratory birds are known to use these estuaries of national and international importance to some wader species.
            Such an abundance of birdlife indicates a rich benthic community of invertebrate and plant life which supports not only thousands of birds but also commercial and recreational fish.
            These estuaries are used by the fish for feeding, breeding nurseries, passage to fresh water and as hospital blocks and are essential to the productivity and fishing of Top of the South coastal waters.</p>
          <p>At least 25 species of commercial and recreational fish use the Nelson and Marlborough estuaries for feeding, breeding, nurseries, passage to fresh water and as hospital blocks.
            These estuaries are essential to coastal productivity.</p>
          <p>Check out the Friends of Nelson Haven & Tasman Bay's booklet to see just what we have done since 1973! and the Annual Reports will tell you what we have done recently.</p>

      <p class="p-style">In 2014 the Friends celebrated, along with the Nelson Tasman branch of the Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society, a woman who was instrumental in the founding of both organisations.
        A "standing room" only event at the Victory Communty Centre in Nelson commemorated ornithologist, writer, philanthopist and founder of the Abel Tasman National Park, Perrine Moncrieff.
        Guest speaker ornitholgist David Melville, currently engaged in research work in China,  gave a fascinating presention about our migratory species -
        skilfully weaving in references to Perrine's own ornithological work as well (as contributions in School Journals from the same period!)
        - demonstrating just how the science of ornithology has changed through the years, with for instance the tagging of birds,
        electronic tracking and captive breeding.</p>

      <p class="donate-text">To ensure our continued effectiveness in a time of increasingly higher costs, mostly caused by our efforts to achieve environmental sustainability in the aquaculture industry,
        we need substantial funds for both research and expert assistance.  Our funds come from our members, member groups, business and government.
        Much of our work is done pro bono or at reduced fees but the costs are still in the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<!-- FUNDING SECTION -->

      <div class="funding__container">
        <h1>FUNDING</h1>
        <p>The Society's work over the last year has beeen "ground-breaking".
          We have supported groups including the Environmental Defence Society and Sustain Our Sounds in cases involving NZ King Salmon's
          plan change for more salmon farms outside of the coastal zones approved for aquaculture by Marlborough District Council,
          through the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) process and ultimately to the Supreme Court.
          The outcome of the Supreme Court's decision meant greater clarity about what the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement 2010 actually means.
          Already this Supreme Court decision has meant that other aquaculture cases that the Friends have submitted on to the Environment Court,
          either as an appellant or a section 274 Resource Management Act party, have had good outcomes for the complex marine environment of the Marlborough Sounds.
          The decision also has helped to clarify the importance of protection and preservation of areas of outstanding natural character,
          and outstanding natural features and landscapes (ONFL) of coastal and marine areas in relation to the NZCPS 2010 and Section 6 of the RMA.</p>
        <p>Work for the Friends is on-going - aquaculture proposals will no doubt continue to be lodged, and issues such as natural character, and natural features and landscapes will need to be addressed,
          in the public interest, by the Friends.  Based on our experience with previous Council (mainly Marlborough District Council,
          Tasman District Council and Nelson City Council) hearings and the subsequent Environment Court processes,
          legal and expert witness costs (for the Environment Court) for appeal cases could be between NZ$90,000,- to NZ$100,000.
          The Society is fortunate being able to call upon a number of expert witnesses in various fields like tourism, marine biology, ornithology, navigation,
          landscape planning and legal counsel. Assistance is often provided pro bono or with heavily reduced costs, but travel expenses and incidentals arise.</p>
        <p>We ask for your support in our work in securing balanced development of the coastline.
          The sustainable use of this "resource" will not only guarantee the protection of ecological values in our area but will also create a diverse range of opportunities for the people living here.
          We would be happy to provide additional information such as references and letters of support, auditors report and Chairmanâ€™s Report and copies of various cases presented by our Society.</p>
